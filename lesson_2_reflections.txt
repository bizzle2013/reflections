What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	it creates a git repository with nothing in it. You need to do it to
	have the ability to do version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to add components to the workspace without
	recording a commit. Doing this allows full version control
